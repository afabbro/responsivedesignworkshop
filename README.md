responsivedesignworkshop
========================

A crash course in responsive design with [Angelina Fabbro](angelina@steamclocksw.com) & [Jacky Gilbertson](jackymakesthings@gmail.com). These materials were used for a short tutorial presented courtesy of Women in Computing Science at Simon Fraser University on August 1st, 2012.

How to use this stuff
---------

- Tutorial files for example website we built can be found [here](http://http://jackygilbertson.ca/catcafe/) in the footer. They're also in the Github repository here with the presetation as '/code/'

- The presentation was made using [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/). Open index.html in a hip browser like Chrome and you'll be set. Take a look in the HTML for the speaker notes. Angelina used some inline styles when she was writing her slides on the fly; this was for speed and is not a technique you should use when developing your own awesome websites.
